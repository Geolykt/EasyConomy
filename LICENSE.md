## EasyconomyAdvanced Licenses

This project is licensed under two licenses where as the [main API](./API/) is licensed under the [BSD 2-Clause "Simplified" License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause) and the [bukkit implementation](./Bukkit/) is licensed under the [GNU General Public License v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).

Reason for the split between these two licenses is that the bukkit api is licensed under GPLv3, which requires that derivatives (which includes plugins) have the same license, we believe that this is dumb and as such the API which is cross-plattform is licensed under a license that does not have such limitations.
