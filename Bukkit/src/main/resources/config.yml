  # The console (as in system command line) command to execute after the files have been copied due to the backup folder,
  # it is primarily used for compression (however can be used for other things).
  # I recommend calling a script file directly as java got some issues handling the commands directly, 
  # even if that is possible. In that case the first string is the command to call,
  # all other strings in the list are the arguments. An empty list will result in no process being started. 
  # The command is executed in the plugins/<plugin>/backups/ folder and can only run up to 15 seconds,
  # after that it is gracefully terminated.

  # DO NOT MODIFY THE LINE BELOW IF YOU GOT NO IDEA WHAT THIS DOES - IT CAN BRICK YOUR SYSTEM IF USED UNWISELY.
